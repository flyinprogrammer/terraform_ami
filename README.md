# Terraform AMI

The goal of this repo is to get you comfortable building AMIs with Packer, and then referencing those AMIs
in Terraform code. It might also server as a nice boilerplate for getting started with Spot Fleet.

This tutorial does require that you have the [Terraform Base](https://github.com/flyinprogrammer/terraform_base)
tutorial already deployed, and it relies on you still having a Default VPC.
